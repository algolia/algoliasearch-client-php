## Change Log

### UNRELEASED

<Contributors, please add your changes below this line>

* Enable `JSON_UNESCAPED_UNICODE` option on POST/PUT requests payload. 

### 1.28.0

* Introduce `$client->multipleGetObjects()` to retrieve objects via ObjectID
    across multiple indices
    
* fix `$index->waitTask` to return task, behavior prior to 1.27.0

### 1.27.0

* Introduce AB Testing feature - PR [#408](https://github.com/algolia/algoliasearch-client-php/pull/#408)
    List/Create/Stop/Delete AB Tests programmatically
    Introduce new Analytics object, wrapper around the
    [Analytics API](https://www.algolia.com/doc/rest-api/analytics/) (more methods to come).

* 2 methods about taskID initially available in the `Index` moved to the `Client`. 
    You could get some taskID from the engine without necessarily have an instance of Index, 
    instead of instanciating an index that you won't need, you can now call waitTask and getTaskStatus on the client.
    The original methods on the index still work are **not** deprecated.
 
     ```php
     $client->waitTask($indexName, $taskID)
     $client->getTaskStatus($indexName, $taskID)
    ```
    
### 1.26.1

* Fix PHP warning when using `searchDisjunctiveFaceting` - See [#407](https://github.com/algolia/algoliasearch-client-php/pull/407)

### 1.26.0

🎉 Note to contributors:
Everybody is now able to run the test on Travis, since we moved to temporary credentials.️ ⤵️
https://blog.algolia.com/travis-encrypted-variables-external-contributions/

- Fix: `addApiKey` was fixed in 1.25.0 (see changelog entry below). The same fix was ported to `updateApiKey`.

- Fix: Curl was added to the composer requirements. If you get an error because curl is not enabled in CLI, enable it or use the flag `--ignore-platform-reqs`

- Fix: Adding a rule with an empty ID failed silently, it will now throw an exception

- Deprecation: Keys should not be managed at the Index level but at the Client level

    All methods `Index::(list|get|add|update)ApiKeys()` are now
    deprecated. If you already have keys on the Index, it would be best
    to delete them and regenerate new keys with client, adding the `indexes`
    restriction.

    Example:
    ```php
    $client->addApiKey([
        'acl' => 'search',
        'indexes' => 'my_index_name',
    ])
    ```
- Fix: Add $requestHeaders arg to Index::browse and Index::deleteBy

- Fix: When browsing, ensure cursor is passed in the body
    Cursor can become so long that the generated URL fails (error HTTP 414).

- Chore: Add PHP version to the UserAgent

### 1.25.1

- feat(places): Set write hosts when using Places

Even though Algolia Places indices are read-only, we still need to take into
account the write hosts to let the user generate its own API keys.

### 1.25.0

- feat: Let you define all API keys capabilities in one array

    Example:
    ```php
    $client->addApiKey([
        'acl' => [
            'search',
            'listIndexes',
        ],
        'validity' => $validity,
        'maxQueriesPerIPPerHour' => 1000,
        'maxHitsPerQuery' => 50,
        'indexes' => ['prefix_*'],
    ]);
    ```
    instead of
    ```php
    $client->addApiKey(['search', 'listIndexes'], $validity, 1000, 50, ['prefix_*']);
    ```

### 1.24.0

- feat: Introduce ScopedCopyIndex method, to copy settings, synonyms or query rules between indices

### 1.23.1
